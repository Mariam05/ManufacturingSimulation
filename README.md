# Manufacturing Simulation

## Running the Simulation
- This program requires Python 3 to be installed
- Install all the libraries required to run the program (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). You might want to consider running the program within a python virtual env.
- Run the sim.py file from an IDE or CMD line (`python sim.py`)

Ask TA about:
- how to handle service times: should we select them in order or randomly?
- If we need to generate table. 
- if they're gonna run our code.
- random generation of inspector 2 componenets (Cumulative probability table?)
